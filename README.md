# Safer Machine Learning Security - Cookiercutter

A base cookiecutter projet to get started productionising your machine learning models.



### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 2.7 or 3.5+
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```


### To start a new project, run:
------------

    cookiecutter -c v1 https://github.com/EthicalML/sml-security

### The resulting directory structure
------------

The directory structure of your new project looks like this:
